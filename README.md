## Getting Started

To install this example application, run the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-angular-ivy-example.git
cd okta-angular-ivy-example
npm install
```

### Create an OIDC App on Okta

Register a new application by going to **Applications** > **Add Application**. On the next screen, choose **Single Page App** and click **Next**.

On the following screen, you can edit the application's settings. Make sure that the port number is 4200 and the base URI is `http://localhost:4200/`. Change the Login Redirect URI to `http://localhost:4200/login`. Once you are done, you will see a **Client ID**.

### Configure your Okta Settings

Copy your org URL and client ID into `src/app/auth.service.ts`:

```js
private authClient = new OktaAuth({
  issuer: 'https://{YourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default',
  clientId: '{ClientId}'
});
```

Start everything with `ng serve` and you'll be able to login with Angular Material and Okta!
